Course description
Statistics is the science of extracting knowledge from data. Before the advent of computers, datasets were restricted to what could be measured and painstakingly recorded by hand (think of Mendel's genetics experiments). Now, the pipeline of turning observable phenomena into data has been dramatically broadened by the ubiquitousness of sensors and input devices, and the internet to transfer the extracted data across the world. The Data Sciences represent all of the facets of working with and extracting knowledge from data, such as data extraction, processing, curation, maintenance, representation, visualization, exploration, hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, prediction.

In this course, we will focus on data science tools (E.g. Python).  First, we will see collaboration, presentation, and containerization tools git, jupyter, pip, virtualenv.  Second we will go over data processing and munging tools such as python base language (strings, input/output), numpy, pandas, sqlite.  Third, we will learn data extraction from the web with requests, html parsing, and APIs.  Fourth, we will learn data visualization tools such as matplotlib.
